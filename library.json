    "description": "A Unified Sensor driver for the QMC6310 magnetometer/compass IC from QST Corporation. The QMC6310 is a three-axis magnetic sensor with IÂ²C serial interface that integrates magnetic sensors and a signal condition ASIC into one silicon chip. The library requires the `Adafruit Unified Sensor`. \nVersion 4 of the QMC6310_Unified driver library is a complete re-write. This means many of the internals and non-interface elements have changed. The Adafruit Unified Sensor interface is still strictly implemented, however, so the breaking changes will only affect code that used device-specific fields, enums and structs. \n We have also added a host of methods that allow setting of device parameters and reading the device registers. This allows implementers to customize the device and also obtain diagnostic data during operation.",
